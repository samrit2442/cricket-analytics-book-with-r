After unzipping we should have multiple .csv files that corresponds to each T20 International matches. There will be another file with same match ids but a suffix \"\\_info\" giving the information of match summary. Our first objective will be to collate all the ball by ball data in a single file or a data frame in R.\n\nWe will download the raw data as a zip file, unzip and save all the files in a directory.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nurl <- \"https://cricsheet.org/downloads/t20s_male_csv2.zip\"\ndownload.file(url, dest = \"bbb_dataset.zip\", mode = \"wb\")\n# unzip(\"t20s_male_csv2.zip\", exdir = dataset_name)\n```\n:::\n",
