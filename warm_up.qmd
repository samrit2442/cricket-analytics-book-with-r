To know the game of cricket, you need to know the history, when and how it was started.

# Data Collection and Sources

There are lot of data sources available online to get started our analysis.

Here, we will mainly focus on the ball-by-ball data so that we can achieve the insights from more granular level.

We will be using open source data from [cricsheet.org](https://cricsheet.org).

## Data Description

The raw data will be downloaded as a zip file. After unzipping we should have multiple .csv files that corresponds to each T20 International matches. There will be another file with same match ids but a suffix "\_info" giving the information of match summary. Our first objective will be to collate all the ball by ball data in a single file or a data frame in R.
