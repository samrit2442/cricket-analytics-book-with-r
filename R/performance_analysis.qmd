## Batting Performance Analysis

In every format of cricket, there are couple of metrics available to measure batting performance of a cricketer. Among them, the most used and popular is Batting Average and Strike Rate.

Batting Average is defined by the ratio of the total runs scored by a batter to the total number of dismissed innings (i.e. the number of innings in which he/she got dismissed by the opponent teams).

Mathematically, we can write the Batting Average (Traditional Batting Average) as

$$
\text{TBA} = \dfrac{\text{Total Runs Scored}}{\text{Total Number of Dismissed Innings}}
$$
